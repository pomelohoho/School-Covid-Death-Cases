# #Observations: The Adjusted R-squared is higher when MostCommonLearningMode is included in the model (0.5328 vs. 0.5152). This suggests that the inclusion of MostCommonLearningMode provides a slightly better fit of the model to the data, explaining a bit more variance in the dependent variable.
#Some categories of MostCommonLearningMode and their interactions with other variables do show statistical significance, which suggests that MostCommonLearningMode could have a meaningful impact in certain contexts or when interacting with other variables.
#MostCommonLearningMode does seem to have a significant impact on the model to some extent. Its inclusion improves the model fit marginally and some of its categories or interactions with other variables are statistically significant.
